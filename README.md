# memory-journal
A way of tracking memories and categorizing all of those special moments you have with everyone around you. Inspired by my love, TJM. I hope that Memory Journal will be a fun and convenient way of organizing photos. Memory Journal extracts the meta-data from .jpeg files and uses that information to create a timeline journal of your photos.
It isn't hosted publicly (unless you want it to) because this is the kind of project where you need to download it, run a script, and then it extracts all of those beloved photos. No ads, no sniffing, this project is yours the moment  you download it.

## Installation
1. Visit http://www.exiv2.org/ and download the .exe or bin.
2. Add the exiv2 binary to your PATH.
3. run `npm install`
